# Udacity MLND Capstone

Capstone project for Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree

## Problem Statement

This is a classification problem. Inputs will be the building details and the output will be the prediction of the extent of damage that has been done to a building after an earthquake. The damage to a building is categorized in five grades. Each grade depicts the extent of damage done to a building post an earthquake.



## Datasets

In this dataset consist of the before and after details of nearly one million buildings after an earthquake provided by the hackerearth. This dataset is free to download.
